# ShoppingCartBackend_using-OOPS-in-Cpp


# A perfect Blend of Data-Structures and OOPS to build a real-time backend system
## This project makes use of a Hashmap in C++ to keep track of the products in the carts
## It also uses the KISS(Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY(Don't epeat Yourself) Object Oriented Principles 

This is a repository that contains files related to the project of a real time Shopping Cart Backend in C++

It makes use of the OOPS design principles and core concepts like:                        
1.Data Hiding                         
2.Abstraction                 
3.Encapsulation                     
4.friend functions                     
5.access specfiers                       
6.Constructors(All three types of constructors like default,parameterized and Copy constructor)               
7.Getters and Setters                

Core functionalities of the Shopping Cart Backend:                   
1)View the products available in the Shop                         
2)Choose the products along with the quantities of the products                        
3)A Checkout functionality where a user can pay the amount and Checkout on a successful payment processing                         




**A Slight Description on the organization of the files**

1)The model.h file containts the required classes for the respective Product,item and the cart                           
2)The cart_main.cpp imports the model.h header file to make use of the functionalities provided by the header file.
